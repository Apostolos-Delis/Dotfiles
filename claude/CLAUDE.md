# Global Context

Full-stack developer on macOS. Primary languages: Python, TypeScript, Ruby.

## My Preferences

- **No comment pollution**: Don't add comments, docstrings, or type annotations to code you didn't write
- **Minimal diffs**: Only change what's directly needed - no drive-by refactors or "improvements"
- **No premature abstraction**: Three similar lines > unnecessary helper function
- **Let tooling handle style**: Don't manually format - run the project's linter/formatter
- **Understand before fixing**: Read surrounding code and find root cause before changing anything

## Git Commits

- Atomic commits focused on one change
- Message format: imperative mood, explain "why" not "what"
- Run project's existing test/lint commands before committing

## Shell Shortcuts (available in my environment)

- `gsedit` - Open git-modified files in nvim
- `root` - cd to git repo root
- `killp <port>` - Kill process on port
